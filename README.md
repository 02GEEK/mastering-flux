# [Mastering Flux - The course](https://www.02skills.com/p/mastering-flux/)

Mastering Flux is the gateway course for mastering data in a React world. The concepts presented in this course will change the way you develop and make one of the most coveted skills around these days as accessible as an apple pie (if your American ;). This course is not a starter course in any way and to be able to be part of it you should already be a skilled JavaScript developer with familiarity with React, NPM and working in Shell (topics covered in our grand [Mastering React Bundle](https://www.02skills.com/p/the-massive-reactjs-bundle/)).
